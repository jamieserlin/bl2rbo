###### basic ai:
a path it tries to follow based on a random offset to the side
makes sure to avoid other cars too
ensure the ai knows where sharp turns are for drifting(possibly make if there is a sharp curve it drifts to go back on course? dont let it slow down often so it needs to drift more so it looks better)
